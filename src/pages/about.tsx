                from within Malawi and abroad. A total of 34 Higher Education

                The 2018 Nkopola Lodge Conference was organised by public and
                private universities in Malawi, including, representatives from
                the Association of Private Universities Malawi; Ministry of
                Education, Science and Technology; National Council for Higher
                Education and Friends of Higher Education.

                In 2018, the conference theme was 'Higher Education in the 21st
                Century. The conference aimed at bringing academics, higher
                education managers, policymakers and other stakeholders together
                to discuss opportunities and challenges facing Higher Education
                in the 21st Century. Participants and paper presenters shared
                experiences, opportunities, and best practices on how to deal
                with the challenges. It was clear that our community needed to
                interface routinely, hence the idea was born to propose the
                establishment of an association at the national level to promote
                HEI issues. The Association has since been established and
                annual conferences are now part of the Association's agenda.
